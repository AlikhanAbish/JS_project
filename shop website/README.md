How It Works
User Preferences

Login/Logout: When a user logs in, their username is saved in local storage. This information remains stored and keeps the user logged in across page reloads. The session is cleared only when the user chooses to log out.

Theme Mode: The website includes a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes. The selected mode is stored in local storage, allowing the user’s preferred theme to load automatically upon revisiting the website.
